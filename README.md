# Simple Pong w/ C++ and SFML 
## Introduction
This is a fun little of Pong written in C++ using SFML. I wrote this game with my kids for a little bit of fun together.
Right now there is only one state [GameState]; however, I will be added more states to change the difficulty, multiball mode ect.
The balls multiply based on the speed level.
